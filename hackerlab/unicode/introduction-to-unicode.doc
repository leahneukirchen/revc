 *(h0 "An Absurdly Brief Introduction to Unicode"
 *    :appendix)

This chapter is a very succinct introduction to the Unicode character
set.  It may be useful when trying to read this manual, but it is not
intended to be a thorough introduction.  One place to learn more about
Unicode is the web site of the Unicode Consortium:
url:"http://www.unicode.org".  The current definition of Unicode is published
as *The Unicode Standard Version 4.0* by the Unicode Consortium.

/************************************************************************
 *(h1 "Characters")
 *

Unicode defines a set of "abstract characters".  Roughly speaking,
abstract characters represent indivisable marks that people use in
writing systems to convey information.  In western alphabets, for
example, ^latin small letter A^ is the name of an abstract character.
That name doesn't refer to *a* in a particular font, but rather to the
idea of ^small A^ in general.

Unicode includes a number of abstract characters which are formatting
marks: they give an indication of how adjacent characters should be
rendered but do not themselves correspond to what one might ordinarily
think of as a ``written character''.

Unicode includes a number of abstract characters which are control
characters: they have traditional (and sometimes standard) meaning in
computing, but do not correspond to any feature of human writing.

Unicode includes a number of abstract characters which are usually
combined with other characters (such as diacritical marks and vowel
marks).

The goal of Unicode is to encode the complete set of abstract
characters used in human writing, sufficient to describe all written
text.

The situation is complicated by three factors: the necessarily large
size of a global character set; the occasionally arbitrary decisions
that must be made about what counts as an abstract character and what
does not; and the generally acknowledged desirability of supporting
bijective mappings between a variety of older character sets and
subsets of Unicode.

/************************************************************************
 *(h1 "Code Points")
 *
A code point is an integer value which is assigned to an abstract
character.  Each character receives a unique code point.

By convention, code points are always written in hexadecimal notation,
prefixed by the string "U+".  Usually, no less than four hexadecimal
digits are written.

Unicode code points are in the closed range `U+0000 .. U+10FFFF'.
Thus, it requires at least 21 bits to hold a Unicode code point.
Sometimes people say that ``Unicode is a 16-bit character set.'': that
is an error.

|assigned (code point, Unicode)|
There are (now and for the forseeable future) many more code points
than abstract characters.  Revisions to Unicode add new characters
and, sometimes, recommend against using some old characters, but once
a code point has been ``assigned'', that assignment never changes.

/************************************************************************
 *(h1 "Some Special Code Points")
 *
Unicode code points `U+0000 .. U+007F' are essentially the same as
ASCII code points.

Unicode code points `U+0000 .. U+00FF' are essentially the same as ISO
8859-1 code points (``Latin 1'').

Two code points represent non-characters.  These are `U+FFFE' and
`U+FFFF'.  Programs are free to give these values special meaning
internally.

The code point `U+FEFF' is assigned to the formatting character
``zero-width no-break space''.  This character has a special
significance when it occurs in certain serialized representations of
Unicode text.  This is described in the next section.

Code points in the range `U+D800 .. U+DFFF' are called "surrogates".
They are not assigned to abstract characters.  Instead, they are used
in pairs as one way to represent a code point in the range `U+10000
.. U+10FFFF'.  This is also described in the next section.

/************************************************************************
 *(h1 "Encoding Forms")
 *

If Unicode code points occupy 21-bits of storage, how is a string of
Unicode text represented? There are three recommended alternatives
called `UTF-8', `UTF-16' and `UTF-32'. Collectively, systems of
representing strings are known as "encoding forms".

The definition of an encoding form consists of a "code unit" (an
unsigned integer with a fixed number of bits, usually fewer than 21)
and a rule describing a bijective mapping between code points and
sequences of code units. UTF-8 uses 8-bit code units. UTF-16 uses
16-bit code units. Unsurprisingly, UTF-32 uses 32-bit code units.

In UTF-8, code points in the range `U+0000 .. U+007F' are stored in a
single code unit (one byte).  Other code points are represented by a
sequence of two or more code units, each byte in the range `80 .. FF'.
The details of these multi-byte sequences are available in countless
Unicode reference materials.

In UTF-16, code points in the range `U+0000 .. U+FFFF' are stored in a
single 16-bit code unit.  Other code points are represented by a pair
of surrogates, each stored in one code unit.  Again, the details of
multi-code-unit sequences are readily available elsewhere.

In UTF-32, code units are 32 bits and each code point is stored in a
single code unit. This is the simplest encoding, and the only
fixed-width one. This fact greatly simplifies implementations, since
UTF-32 processing does not require testing for the presence of
surrogates. However, 99% of current code units fit in 16 bits (i.e.,
belong into what is called the "Basic Multilingual Plane" or BMP), and
using the UTF-32 encoding is obviously very inefficient when it comes
to memory usage. As a result, UTF-16 is often preferred over UTF-32.

Not every sequence of 8-bit values is a valid UTF-8 string.  Not
every sequence of 16-bit values is a valid UTF-16 string.  Strings
that are not valid are called ``ill-formed''.
|ill-formed (code sequence, Unicode)|

When stored in the memory of a running program, UTF-16 and UTF-32 code
units are almost certainly stored in the native byte order of the
machine. In files and when transmitted, two byte orders are possible.
When byte order distinctions are important, the names UTF-16be,
UTF-32be (big-endian) and UTF-16le, UTF-32le (little-endian) are used.
In Unicode parlance, we say that the three encoding forms UTF-8,
UTF-16 and UTF-32 result in seven "encoding schemes", namely, UTF-8,
UTF-16, UTF-16be, UTF-16le, UTF-32, UTF-32be and UTF-32le. Encoding
forms refer to integer data in memory or APIs, while character
encoding schemes refer to byte-serialized data.

When a stream of text has a UTF-16 or UTF-32 encoding form, and when
its byte order is not known in advance, it is marked with a "byte
order mark". A byte order mark is the formatting character
``zero-width no-break space'' (`U+FEFF') occuring as the first
character in the stream. By examining the first two bytes of such a
stream, and assuming that those bytes are a byte order mark, programs
can determine the byte-order of code units within the stream. When a
byte order mark is present, it is not considered to be part of the
text which it marks.

/************************************************************************
 *(h1 "Character Properties")
 *

In addition to naming a set of abstract characters, and assigning
those characters to code points, the definition of Unicode assigns
each character a collection of "character properties".

The possible properties a character may have and their meanings are
too numerous to list here.  Three examples are:

\general category/ -- such as ``lowercase letter'', ``uppercase letter'',
``decimal digit'', etc.

\decimal digit value/ -- if the character is used as a decimal digit,
this property is its numeric value.

\case mappings/ -- the default lowercase character corresponding to an
uppercase character, and so forth.

The Unicode consortium publishes definitions of various character
properties and distributes text files listing those properties for
each code point.  For more information, visit url:"http://www.unicode.org".
