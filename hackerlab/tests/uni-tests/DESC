We test the installed header files to make sure they compile.

unit-coding, unit-cvt

	Both programs convert between UTF-8, UTF-16 and UTF-32.

	unit-cvt is based on "ConvertUTF.c" (called "cvtutf.c" here).
	ConvertUTF.c is distributed on the CD-ROM that comes with the
	Unicode standard and from the unicode.org web site (we took it
	from there). It is used here as a reference implementation of
	conversions.

	unit-coding is based on the conversion functions in
	"hackerlab/uni/coding.h".

	unit-coding.sh converts a UTF-8 file to UTF-16 and UTF-32, and
	back again, using both native and non-native byte order,
	comparing the results produced by the two programs.
