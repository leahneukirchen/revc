  An Overview of GNU Arch<br>
  <hr align="left" width="14%">
  <small>A Brief Description of the <code>GNU Arch</code><br>
  Revision Control System<br>
  </small>
</h1>

<p>
  Below is a brief list of the features that most distinguish Gnu Arch
  from competing systems. This list presumes that you are somewhat
  familiar with revision control systems in general. (See also, 
  <a href="./what-is-revctl.html">What is Revision Control?</a>)  






  <h2>Whole Tree Changesets: Atomic Commits and Add/Delete/Rename Handling
</h2>
  <p>
    Transactions in Gnu Arch are on <i>whole source trees</i>. For example,
  let's suppose that you modify three files in order to fix a
  bug. When you commit this change, you commit all three files at
  once. Arch records a new revision that contains exactly the
  modifications to those three files (relative to some earlier
  revision).




  <p>
    Atomic, whole-tree commits are very convenient. To continue the
  example: you could record the name of the new revision in your bug
  database as the revision that contains the bug-fix. Or you could
  send the name of the new revision to a fellow-programmer, who can
  then merge exactly those changes and no others into his own
  branch. A project maintainer can ask arch to display exactly those
  changes in order to review your work.




  <p>
    Whole tree changesets in Arch correctly handle file, directory, and
  symbolic link additions, removals, and renames. &quot;Correctly handle&quot;
  means not only that such changes are recorded as part of the
  changeset, but also that you can merge changes back and forth
  between versions that do and do not have those tree-structure
  changes, and the merging process will take that into account.







  <h2>Symbolic Revision Names
</h2>
  <p>
    Arch assigns revisions meaningful, symbolic names that are globally
  unique among a community of arch users. Thus, it is always possible
  to refer unambiguously to any given revision, in any Arch
  archive. Strange annoyances such as CVS's &quot;even/odd length&quot; branch
  and revision numbering scheme or Subversions global repository
  revision number are avoided in Arch.







  <h2>Easy Branching and Smart Merging
</h2>
  <p>
    Creating a branch in Arch can be accomplished with a single, fast command.




  <p>
    Merging between branches in Arch is <i>history sensitive</i> which means
  that Arch helps to avoid spurious merge conflicts by avoiding
  redundent merges whenever it can.




  <p>
    In fact, there are <i>many</i> different kinds of merging that are useful
  in the world (e.g., CVS-like updates, cherry-picking,
  vendor-branch-style tracking, mutual 3-way merges between
  branches...). Rather than provide just one merge command, Arch
  provides a <i>toolbox</i> of several merge commands, allowing you to pick
  the right tool for each job.







  <h2>Versioned Tagging
</h2>
  <p>
    Tags in Arch are as easy to create as branches (in fact, the same
  mechanism is used).




  <p>
    Tags can be &quot;moved&quot; in Arch and, when the are, data about their old
  location is preserved. In other words, tags are revision controlled
  just like source.







  <h2>Lightweight, Standard Servers; Simple On-disk Formats
</h2>
  <p>
    Arch uses a collection of stone-simple on-disk formats for archives
  and ancillary databases. It does not require or use a relational
  database, hash-table database, object database, or CVS-like &quot;,v&quot;
  files.




  <p>
    Consequently, creating a new local archive is utterly trivial: a
  single arch command does it, basically by creating some new
  directories.




  <p>
    And, consequently, remote archives <i>do not require an Arch specific
  server!</i> Your existing <b><code>SFTP</code></b>, <b><code>FTP</code></b>, or <b><code>WebDav</code></b> server can
  be used as an Arch server. Your existing <b><code>HTTP</code></b> server can be used
  as a read-only Arch server.







  <h2>Distributed Operation
</h2>
  <p>
    Branches, in Arch, are not required to be in the same archive as the
  branched-from version. In fact, creating a branch requires nothing
  more than read-only access to the branched-from version.




  <p>
    Operation across archive boundaries in Arch is essentially seemless:
  commands operate equally well on local and remote archives and on
  versions scattered across multiple archives.




  <p>
    For public and inter-organizational development projects distributed
  operation is an especially valuable feature: contributors can form
  and publish their work on their own branches of your mainline
  sources -- without requiring that they have write access to your
  archive. You can merge in their changes as easily as if they had
  been committed to your own archives.







  <h2>Integrity Checking and Signed Revisions
</h2>
  <p>
    Archive revisions are protected against storage-media corruption by
  checksum files which are verified during ever
  retrieval. Additionally, committed revisions can be
  cryptographically signed by their creators, and those signatures
  verified on retrieval.







  <h2>Easy Mirroring
</h2>
  <p>
    It is trivial to set-up and incrementally update read-only mirrors
  of any arch archive. A common pattern of use in public projects is
  to improve performance by creating private local copies of remote
  archives.
