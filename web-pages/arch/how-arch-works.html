  How Arch Works<br>
  
</h1>

<div class="abstract-body">

  <p>
    To understand what a device is good for, it is often helpful to
      take it apart and examine how it works. Here's an introduction
      to how Arch does what it does.




</div>

<p>
  This page contains a brief dissection of Arch -- a high-level
  description of how Arch works. The intention is to give technically
  savvy readers deeper insight into Arch by helping them to develop
  some intuitions about how Arch is implemented.




<p>
  There are two parts and, depending on your interests, you might want
  to skip the first. These are:

  <a href="#performance">Performance Principles</a>




<p>
  <a href="#layers">A Layered Architecture</a>






  <h2>Performance Principles
</h2>
  <p>
    <a name="performance"><b><code>{performance}</code></b></a>




  <p>
    Before examining the details of the Arch implementation directly, it
  will be helpful to name a few performance principles that shape the
  overall design:




  
    <h3>Minimize Server-side Computation
</h3>
    <p>
      Arch allows multiple users to access a single archive over a
  network. Consequently, although it also supports serverless, local
  operation, Arch must support a client-server mode of operation.




    <p>
      We wish Arch to scale in number of concurrent users accessing an
  archive as far as possible. For example, if a popular project
  commits an important bug-fix, there may be thousands or tens of
  thousands of users who want to update their local sources after that
  commit.




    <p>
      Consequently, the design of Arch aims to




    <blockquote class="saying">
      <b>minimize server-side computation </b><br>
      <br>
      <b>minimize input-output bandwidth requirements </b><br>
      
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      The primary strategy for doing so is to




    <blockquote class="saying">
      <b>maximize the client-side share </b><br>
      <b>of unavoidable computation </b><br>
      
    </blockquote>

  
  
  
    <h3>Disk Space is Cheap
</h3>
    <p>
      Most revision control systems in widespread use today were conceived
  or designed at least a decade and in some cases two decades
  ago. Even some contemporary designs follow design patterns that were
  established that long ago.




    <p>
      Systems designed with that older perspective place a very high
  premium on disk space. Although they work hard to be fast,
  nevertheless they are apt to make trade-offs that consume I/O
  bandwidth and CPU cycles in favor of consuming disk space. Even
  worse, these trade-offs often add to the implementation complexity
  of these systems.




    <p>
      These days, such trade-offs are already somewhat anachronistic and,
  within just a few years, such trade-offs will be completely
  absurd. Multiple gigabyte disks can be had for under $200USD and,
  before long, we'll have terabyte disks in such price ranges. Storage
  at those scales is more than ample for revision control purposes.




    <p>
      The lesson?




    <blockquote class="saying">
      <b>disk space is very cheap </b><br>
      <br>
      <hr width="14%">
      <small><i>If the storage costs of an extravagant configuration of Arch</i><br>
      <i>work out to a few 10s of dollars per programmer, per year, our</i><br>
      <i>disk space usage is not excessive.</i><br>
      <br>
      </small>
    </blockquote>

  
  
  
    <h3>Bandwidth is Expensive
</h3>
    <p>
      Unfortunately, there is for the forseeable future still a sharp
  constraint about just how much disk space we can touch for a given
  arch operation: bandwidth remains expensive, especially relative to
  disk capacity.




    <p>
      I/O Bandwidth costs are imposed at more than one layer. On-device
  cache space limits, seek times, transfer times, OS cache space
  limits, and CPU cache space limits, and main-memory speeds all
  constrain the utility of passing lots of data back and forth to
  disk.





    <blockquote class="saying">
      <b>i/o bandwidth is very expensive </b><br>
      
    </blockquote>

  
  
  
    <h3>Networks are Slow
</h3>
    <p>
      A fast, local network connection can easily have lower latency and
  higher bandwidth than a local disk. Nevertheless, the expected case
  for most Arch operations over a network is that they pass over the
  Internet or a comparable network. Minimizing roundtrips and the
  quantity of data transfered is critical.




    <blockquote class="saying">
      <b>for Arch: </b><br>
      <br>
      <i>1) network bandwidth is more expensive than disk bandwidth</i><br>
      <br>
      <i>2) each network roundtrip may as well be a punch in the face</i><br>
      <br>
      
    </blockquote>

  
  



  <h2>A Layered Architecture
</h2>
  <p>
    And now we turn to the implementation structure of Arch itself. Arch
  is a layered architecture and it's easiest to understand by starting
  at the lowest level and working upwards.  




  
    <h3>Tree Inventories
</h3>
    <p>
      The lowest level concept in Arch is that of a tree inventory.




    <p>
      A tree inventory is a listing of all of the files and directories in
  a tree, with two fields per file or directory. These fields are:




    <p>
      <b>1. a physical name -- </b> the location of a file relative to the root
   of the source tree. For example: <code>./src/include/foo.h</code>




    <p>
      <b>2. an inventory id -- </b> an identifier naming the file. This
  identifier remains constant even if the physical name of the file
  changes.




    <p>
      In other words, if a file is renamed, its physical name changes,
  but its inventory id remains the same. This allows Arch to recognize
  that a file has been renamed by comparing two versions of the
  physical name for a given inventory id. Here is a fragment of a
  directory listing showing physical names and inventory ids:




    
    <pre>

   physical name:               inventory id:

   links/Makefile.in            i_x9034AKLJn3
   links/make-links.sh.in       i_lk3n8908nNx
   links/remove-links.sh.in     i_lk3nn90lkjs


    </pre>

    <p>
      How are inventory ids associated with files? How does arch know what
  the inventory id of a given file is? Three mechanisms are provided:




    <p>
      <b>1. inventory ids can be stored within a file</b> For example, an id
  can be stored in a comment in a C source file. This mechanism is in
  some sense the most convenient, but is only suitable for text files,
  and only for text files that can tolerate such comments.




    <p>
      <b>2. inventory ids can be stored in separate files</b> The inventory id
  for a file foo can be stored in <code>./.arch-ids/foo.id</code>. Special commands
  must be used to rename such a file (so that the .id file is renamed
  at the same time) but this mechanism can be used with any type of
  file.




    <p>
      <b>3. inventory ids can be omitted</b> Users can choose to not assign an
  id to a given file in which case its physical name serves
  double-duty as its inventory id. Arch can not recognize when such a
  file is renamed (since the inventory id will change in the process)
  but for some situtations, this is an acceptable trade-off for the
  convenience of not having to set-up ids.




  
  
  
    <h3>Changesets
</h3>
    <p>
      Traditional <code>diff</code> is most familiar as a way to show the differences
  between two versions of a single file. Given a command line option,
  <code>diff</code> can be recursively applied to all of the same-named files
  within a tree.




    <p>
      Traditional <code>patch</code> is familiar as a way to take the output of
  <code>diff</code>, a description of changes made to a file, and apply those
  changes to some different file.




    <p>
      The next layer of Arch takes diff and patch one step further by
  taking advantage of inventory ids. The arch commands mkpatch/dopatch
  (aka make-changeset/apply-changeset) produce and apply a whole-tree
  diff-like account of differences, taking into account renames, adds,
  and deletes. Additionally, these arch commands handle symbolic
  links, binary files, and file permissions.




    <p>
      For example, as we'll see below, when you commit a set of changes,
  that operation records the mkpatch output of your modified tree
  compared to the unmodified version you &quot;checked out&quot; from an archive.




  
  
  
    <h3>Namespace and Archive
</h3>
    <p>
      The combination of mkpatch/dopatch and inventory ids allows for a kind
  of &quot;by hand&quot; approach to revision control in the <code>diff/patch</code>
  style. Programmers could cooperate by exchanging and applying
  changesets created by mkpatch much as they can cooperate by creating
  and exchanging patch sets made by <code>diff</code>.




    <p>
      The next layer of arch, the namespace and archive layer, essentially
  just automates that by hand process. It provides a mechanism for
  naming (with globally unique, human-readable names) the changesets
  programmers create, and a mechanism for publishing changesets and
  retrieving published changesets.




  
  
  
    <h3>Global Revision Names
</h3>
    <p>
      The arch namespace is organized around the concept of a development
  line -- a sequence of revisions ordinarilly beginning with a
  complete tree called a <i>base revision</i> and proceding with a number
  of successive <i>changeset revisions</i>, each defined relative to its
  predecessort by a changeset.




    <p>
      For example, a programmer might initially import the source for an
  implementation of tar creating a base revision named:




    
    <pre>
	tar--mainline--1.0--base-0

    </pre>

    <p>
      After fixing a bug, the programmer can commit the changeset
  describing the bugfix. The changeset and the tree resulting from
  applying it are known as:




    
    <pre>
	tar--mainline--1.0--patch-1

    </pre>

    <p>
      Additional work and more commits would yield:




    
    <pre>
	tar--mainline--1.0--patch-1
	tar--mainline--1.0--patch-2
	tar--mainline--1.0--patch-3
        ... etc.

    </pre>

    <p>
      This development line is situated within a particular arch archive
  which itself has a name. Prefixing the archive name to a revision
  name yields a globally unique name for the revision:




    
    <pre>
	lord@emf.net--gnu-archive-2004/tar--mainline--1.0--patch-3

    </pre>

    <p>
      Tags are named in the same way and function comparably to base
  revisions. For example, instead of importing a new source tree to
  create




    
    <pre>
	tar--mainline--1.0--base-0

    </pre>

    <p>
      the programmer might have defined that revision to be a tag revision
  -- more or less an an alias within the namespace. We often use
  notation like:




    
    <pre>
	tar--mainline--1.0--base-0 =&gt; tar--experimental--1.0--patch-4

    </pre>

    <p>
      to mean &quot;the base-0 revision in the mainline branch of tar is a tag
  revision, tagging the patch-4 revision in the experimental branch&quot;. 




  
  
  
    <h3>Archive Storage
</h3>
    <p>
      The most basic role of an arch archive, therefore, is to store base
  revisions, commit revisions, and tag revisions in a way that (1)
  associates them with their name; (2) allows programmers to query and
  retrieve revisions and the changesets and other data associated with
  them.




    <p>
      Internally to arch, the storage mechanism is isolated from the rest of
  the implementation by an abstraction barrier. Entirely new storage
  managers are easy to install.




    <p>
      In practice, only a very simple storage manager is used and experience
  has shown this stone-simple approach to work well. In particular,
  archives are stored as ordinary files: imported base revisions are
  stored as a compressed tar file of the entire source tree; changeset
  revisions created by commit are stored as a compressed tar file
  containing just the changeset; tag revisions are stored as a small
  text file containing the name of the tagged revision.




    <p>
      The stone-simple approach has some enourmous advantages and is one are
  where the performance principles enumerated above come into play. Some
  example advantages:




    <p>
      <b>A server is merely a generic file server</b> The only capability
  needed for an arch server is the ability to create new files and
  directories and retrieve existing ones. Consequently, an unmodified
  FTP, SFTP, or WebDAV server is, already, an arch archive
  server. Nearly no computation takes place server-side and a given
  server can easily support very large numbers of concurrent
  connections.




    <p>
      <b>Network traffic is minimized</b> Imports and commits ship to the
  server compressed tar files of just the essential data of the
  transition. Subsequent retrievals simply read that data back. As a
  result, basic operations require few round-trips and minimal
  bandwidth.




    <p>
      <b>Replication is easy</b> New files are added to archives with every
  commit, tag, or import transaction, but old files are never removed
  or modified. Consequently, it is trivial to replicate and
  incrementally update read-only mirrors of any archive. Arch has a
  built-in facility for this and programs such as rsync can be
  configured to do the job more efficiently.




  
  
  
    <h3>Archive Caching, Revision Libraries and Other Speedups
</h3>
    <p>
      The archive storage layer has many advantages but it also creates a
  performance problem that needs to be solved:




    
      <h4>Simple Archive Formats Can be Slow
</h4>
      <p>
        Consider how, given just the archive storage mechanism described
  above, a particular revision can be retrieved. Let's suppose that we
  want to get a copy of the tree for:




      
      <pre>
	tar--mainline--1.0--patch-4

      </pre>

      <p>
        Absent any other mechanism, we would build that tree with the following steps:




      <p>
        <b>1. retrieve the base revision -- </b> fetch the compressed tar file of
  the <code>base-0</code> revision from an archive and unpack it.




      <p>
        <b>2. retrieve and apply the first changeset -- </b> fetch the compressed
  tar file of the changeset for <code>patch-1</code>, unpack it, and apply the
  changeset to the <code>base-0</code> tree. Now we have a <code>patch-1</code> tree. 




      <p>
        <b>3. retrieve and apply successive changesets -- </b> continue applying
  changesets until we lllreach the desired revision (<code>patch-4</code>).




      <p>
        That's conceptually simple, and it's a direct consequence of our
  choice of &quot;dumb server&quot; storage management, but it is
  problematic. For example, suppose that instead of wanting the
  <code>patch-4</code> revision we wanted the <code>patch-140</code> revision. Instead of having
  to apply four changesets to the base revision, we'd have to apply
  140 -- which would be prohibitively expensive.




      <p>
        Worse, in the case of wanting the <code>patch-140</code> revision, we may find
  ourselves violating some of our performance principles. After all,
  even compressed, those 140 changesets that we'll fetch from the
  server may turn out to be larger than just a complete copy of the
  <code>patch-140</code> tree would be. By not having the server compute that
  complete tree, we may be trading network costs for server costs.




      <p>
        Arch solves these problems with three mechanisms: archive <i>cached
  revisions</i>, <i>archive mirrors</i>, and <i>client-side revision libraries</i>.




    
    
    
      <h4>Archive Cached Revisions
</h4>
      <p>
        One way to reduce the amount of changeset application and network
  bandwidth associated with building a revision is to apply our
  performance principle that disk space is very cheap.




      <p>
        Specifically, we augment the archive format to permit
  (user-directed) caching of pre-built revisions, stored as compressed
  tar files. Continuing the earlier example, a user may have asked
  that the revision <code>patch-130</code> be cached. That means that in addition
  to containing a compressed tar file of the changeset that describes
  how <code>patch-130</code> differs from <code>patch-129</code> the archive will contain a
  compressed tar-file of a pre-built copy of <code>patch-130</code>.




      <p>
        Now, if a user asks for a copy of the <code>patch-140</code> tree, rather than
  starting at <code>base-0</code> then fetching and applying 140 changesets, arch
  will fetch the full-tree copy of <code>patch-130</code> then fetch and apply only
  10 changesets to produce a <code>patch-140</code> tree.




      <p>
        In keeping with our goals of client-side computation and dumb
  servers, when an archive cached revision is created it is
  constructed on some client, bundled as a tar file, and stored on the
  server.




      <p>
        Which revisions should be archive cached? One rational,
  approximately time-and-bandwidth optimal policy would be to space
  cached revisions such that the sum of the sizes of changesets
  between any two cached revisions is about the same as the size as
  the tar file containing the cached revision. Spacing them further
  apart would lead to a situation where sometimes the total size of
  changesets fetched to build a revision exceeds what could have been
  fetched with denser caching. Spacing them closer together will cause
  arch to sometimes fetch a cached revision when it would have been
  faster to fetch several changesets instead. Note that applying this
  policy approximately doubles the size of an archive -- which is
  quite accessible since archives are relatively compact to begin with
  and, after all, disk space is very cheap.




      <p>
        Other caching policies make good sense in some situations,
  though. Therefore, we leave it to users to explicitly cache
  revisions -- a process that can trivially be automated to implement
  whatever policy a user chooses.




    
    
    
      <h4>Archive Mirrors
</h4>
      <p>
        A second technique for saving on network costs is to use archive
  mirrors. Arch contains a facility for constructing and incrementally
  updating local, read-only copies of remote archives. When such a
  mirror is used, each changeset or base revision from the remote
  archive is fetched exactly once and, thereafter, access to it is
  entirely local. In our example, this would still (by default) mean
  applying 140 changesets -- but at least those changesets would
  reside on a local disk.




      <p>
        Archive caching and archive mirroring interact in a favorable
  way. Although mirrors are generally read-only, users may
  archive-cache a revision in a mirror. For example, one reasonable
  set-up is to publish a heavily read archive on the Internet, but
  archive-cache nothing there. Instead, encourage users to mirror from
  that public archive rather than use it directly, and to
  archive-cache according to their needs in their local copies.




    
    
    
      <h4>Revision Libraries
</h4>
      <p>
        The final technique for speeding up arch operations is entirely a
  client-side optimization. As with archive mirrors and archive
  caching, it trades-off disk space for speed.




      <p>
        The technique provides for something called a revisision library. A
  revision library is a read-only collection of pre-built whole-tree
  copies of revisions, stored more or less as ordinary trees.




      <p>
        A special feature of revision libraries is that unmodified files are
  shared between revisions via hard-links. For example, suppose that a
  revision library contains <code>patch-139</code> and we wish to add <code>patch-140</code> to
  the library. The addition happens in two steps: First, a hard-linked
  copy of <code>patch-139</code> is created. All of the files in this copy are
  shared with the original <code>patch-139</code> -- they are the hard-links to the
  two files. Second, the changeset defining <code>patch-140</code> is applied to
  the hard-linked copy. The changeset application process &quot;breaks
  hard-links&quot; for files it modifies. Thus, the end result is a
  <code>patch-140</code> tree in which files that are unmodified since <code>patch-139</code>
  are shared with the <code>patch-139</code> tree via hard-links, and modified
  files are private to the <code>patch-140</code> tree.




      <p>
        This is a reasonably space-efficient way to store many, many
  revisions in space which is a fraction of the sum of their
  individual sizes.




      <p>
        The revision library mechanism is designed to be configurable as a
  cache or memo. Revisions can be automatically added to a library, on
  demand, or they can be explicitly added. It is a trivial matter for
  users to implement a &quot;pruning&quot; policy to discard revisions that are
  no longer needed.




      <p>
        When a revision library is present, many arch operations become
  very, very fast. For example, suppose again that we want a <code>patch-140</code>
  tree and that initially the revision library contains
  <code>patch-139</code>. Arch (suitably configured) will proceed by adding
  <code>patch-140</code> to the library (by creating a hard-linked copy of 139 and
  applying one changeset to it) and then recursively copying the
  resulting tree from the library to the user's work area. If the
  library already contains <code>patch-140</code>, then only the recursive copy is
  necessary.




      <p>
        Often the tools that a user uses to work on their checked-out trees
  are well-behaved with respect to hard-links. Emacs and vi, for
  example, do not modify the files you edit --- they write fresh
  copies of those files containing your modifications and thus they
  break hard-links to those files.




      <p>
        Arch can take advantage of the hard-link-safety of common
  tools. When checking-out a tree, you can ask arch to not recursively
  copy the tree form a revision library but, instead, to make your
  working copy by hard-linking to the revision library. This turns out
  to be a blindingly fast way to check out a tree. (And, arch contains
  integrity checking features for revision libraries. Should your
  tools fail to be hard-link-safe after all, arch will notice and
  protect you from any resulting revision library corruption.)




    
    
    
      <h4>Speedups Summarized
</h4>
      <p>
        The basic archive storage model of arch is simple, space-efficient,
  and often but not always network- and time-efficient. In some cases,
  however, without additional mechanisms, it would lead to gross
  network- and time-inefficiencies.




      <p>
        We eliminate those gross inefficiences with three mechanisms,
  archive caching, archive mirroring, and revision libraries, which
  have in common that that they trade disk-space and client-side
  computation for better performance overall. A pleasant property of
  this approach is that it requires _no_ server-side computation and
  thus, excellent speeds can be achieved without sacrificing the
  scalability or arch in the slightest.




    
    
  
  
  
    <h3>Patch Logs and Merging
</h3>
    <p>
      We've seen so far how arch allows users to commit import, changeset,
  and tag revisions. We've seen that these are assigned globally
  unique names and examined how they are stored in archives. We've
  seen how revisions are retrieved from archives and looked at some of
  the speed-up mechanisms that exist to make retrieval fast.




    <p>
      Now we turn to the question of merging. Suppose, for example, that
  two users are each working on their own development line of a single
  project. Naturally, they may want to share work: each user will want
  to combine his changes with changes made by the other. How does arch
  handle this?




    <p>
      To understand the answer, we must first understand patch logs and
  then we can turn to history sensitive merging.




    
      <h4>Patch Logs
</h4>
      <p>
        Whenever a user creates any new revision he must provide a short
  description of the revision. The description, formatted similarly to
  an email message, contains a header that provides a brief summary of
  the revision, and a body that can contain details.




      <p>
        Arch maintains a special directory, called <code>{arch}</code> in the top level
  of each project tree. This directory contains the patch log entries
  that pertain to the tree.




      <p>
        For example, when a tree is first imported, the user writes a patch
  log entry and that is stored in a file under <code>{arch}</code>, indexed by the
  name of the revision created by the import. The tar bundle
  containing the imported tree contains that patch log file.




      <p>
        Similarly, when a user commits or tags a revision, the patch log
  entry for that new revision is treated like a newly added file -- it
  appears in the associated changeset.




      <p>
        This implies, for one thing, that a given revision contains patch
  log files for its ancestors in its development line. The tree for
  <code>patch-140</code> contains patch log files for <code>base-0</code>, <code>patch-1</code>,
  .... through <code>patch-140</code> itself.




      <p>
        When patch log files are added to a revision, arch adds additional,
  automatically computed headers. For example, one header names all
  newly added files in the revision. Another header reports what files
  have been deleted.




      <p>
        Conveniently, patch log files can be processed and summarized to
  produce a conventional ChangeLog file. In fact, arch has facilities
  to do so automatically.





    
    
    
      <h4>History Sensitive Merging
</h4>
      <p>
        Consider, then, what happens if a user wants to add to his tree the
  changes assocated with a revision made in a different development
  line. For example, suppose that I have checked out a copy of




      
      <pre>
	tar--mainline--1.0--patch-140

      </pre>

      <p>
        and I note that a revision in a different branch, namely




      
      <pre>
	tar--bugfixes--1.0--patch-2

      </pre>

      <p>
        is a changeset revision and that the changes it makes fix a bug I'd
  like fixed in mainline.




      <p>
        Arch can accomplish this quite easily simply by fetching the
  changeset for the bugfix and applying it to my patch-140 tree. That
  changeset treats the patch log entry for the bugfix revision as a
  newly added file. Therefore, after applying the changeset, my (now
  modified) tree for




      
      <pre>
	tar--mainline--1.0--patch-140

      </pre>

      <p>
        will contain a patch log entry for




      
      <pre>
	tar--bugfixes--1.0--patch-2

      </pre>

      <p>
        That's handy in and of itself. For example, if I don't remember
  whether the bug-fix changes have been applied to my tree, I can use
  arch to query the patch log files and look for a record of it having
  been applied.




      <p>
        It's also handy for smart merging. For example, in my mainline tree, I can ask arch:




      
      <pre>
	% tla whats-missing tla--bugfixes--1.0

      </pre>

      <p>
        and it will respond with something like:




      
      <pre>
	patch-1
        patch-3
        patch-4

      </pre>

      <p>
        indicating that I have not applied bugfix patches 1, 3, and 4 -- but
  have applied bugfix patch 2.




      <p>
        Using the summary lines from log messages, arch can report:




      
      <pre>
	% tla --summary whats-missing tla--bugfixes--1.0
	patch-1
        	fix the help message
        patch-3
		fix buffer overflow (bug #238)
        patch-4
		correct exit status  (bug #14)

      </pre>

      <p>
        and a command such as:




      
      <pre>
	% tla whats-missing tla--bugfixes--1.0 | tla replay --list -

      </pre>

      <p>
        will apply just the missing patches but none that I've already applied.




      <p>
        Merging isn't limited to just the changesets created by
  commit. Indeed, arch can compute the differences between any two
  revisions and apply those to my tree as a form of
  merging. Intelligently deciding which two revisions to compare is a
  tricky problem with no one solution -- arch provides a variety of
  solutions, most of which examine patch-logs to help with the
  decision process. This general mechanism is the basis for specific
  history-sensitive merge commands such as star-merge.




    
    
  
  
  
    <h3>And the Rest is Easy
</h3>
    <p>
      The above summarizes the essense of what could be dubbed core
  arch. Although many details have been omitted or glossed over,
  hopefully you now have some intuition about how arch works.




    <p>
      Many commands are built on top of the basic facilities outlined
  above. In all cases, they boil down to simple combinations of the
  above ideas: changeset computation and application, building
  revisions based on archive and revision library data, and so forth.
