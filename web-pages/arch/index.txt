                 The GNU Arch Revision Control System
  ]]

  [[abstract
     /GNU Arch/ is a distributed, democratic, changeset-oriented,
     peer-to-peer revision control system.  /GNU Arch/ is 
     <"/free software/" -- http://www.gnu.org>.

     Started in 2001, the GNU Arch project is a leader and a
     contributor in the efforts of free software and open source
     hackers to develop revolutionary tools to advance
     their efforts.

     This page is a collection of more or less stable links about
     /Arch/.

  site for GNU Arch.

* Orientation

  There are quite a few branches of Arch and different places to get
  different distributions.  Of greatest interest to most users are
  these three (the links provide further information about each
  version, including download links and the like):

  [[blockquote

    /{GNU Arch 1.x}/ also known as /`tla'/.  This version is released
    via the /GNU/ project.  It is relatively *stable workhorse*
    meaning that major new features are not being added and it can
    take a while between releases for minor bugs to be fix.

    /{Canonical Corp's Bazaar}/ also known as /`baz'/ is a branch of
    /tla/.  Releases are made frequently with an emphasis on user
    interface changes and performance tweaks.

    /{GNU Arch 2.0}/ also known as /`revc'/.   This version
    is released by the GNU Arch maintainer and is an entirely
    new source base -- not a branch.   /revc/ radically 
    simplifies Arch while simultaneously generalizing it, 
    all with less and simpler code.

* Reference and Historic Pages

  At various times over the years I've put up pages explaining this
  or that about Arch.   Over time, these tend to become slightly
  outdated -- Arch evolves a little out from under them, or 
  errors are discovered in the pages, or better ways are found to
  say the same thing.   Nevertheless, people still seem to find them
  useful and squawk a bit when they are taken down so here is a 
  list of favorites.

  /Note:/ These pages describe /GNU Arch 1.x/ -- they are not
  very useful for learning about <"/GNU Arch 2.0/" --
  $/revc/index.html>.

  [[blockquote

    <"An Overview of GNU Arch" -- ./arch-overview.html>

    <"How Arch Works" -- ./how-arch-works.html>

    <"What is Revision Control?" -- ./what-is-revctl.html>

* Branch Info

** {*GNU Arch 2.0}

  GNU Arch 2.0 (/`revc'/)is a thorough rewrite of Arch, combining the
  best concepts from the `tla' branches (GNU Arch 1.x and Bazaar) with
  great ideas from systems such as /baz-ng/, /git/, and /monotone/.

  More detailed News about Arch 2.0 is available <"on this site" --
  $/revc/index.html>.


** {*GNU Arch 1.x}

  This release can be downloaded from 'ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu-arch' and
  other GNU mirrors.   The most recent release is `tla-1.3.3'.


** {*Canonical Corp's Bazaar}

  The main portal for this version of Arch
  is <http://bazaar.canonical.com/>.
