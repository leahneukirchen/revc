* {*todo items}

** `revc' Highest Priority TODO Items

  The code is very clean but could use a light reorg, a careful
  review, dealing with all parts marked `dangle' or `debug'.

  The commands need to be implemented: `ancestor', `merged', 
  `get-merge-trees', `prereqs', `init name', `name'.

  Some convenience commands are needed that capture the ideas of
  "branching", "tagging", "merge", and "update".

  Better documentation.
 

** `revc' "Bite-sized tasks"

  Commands such as `revc-add' do no canonicalize their filename
  arguments.  Extra slashes, `/.' components and the like can lead to
  a bogus manifest (fixable by passing the same non-canonical path to
  `revc-del', btw).  A good canonicalizer is desirable and it should
  be sprinkled liberally throughout the code.

  
** `revc' Next Priority TODO Items

  Activate the "blob hint" optimization.

  Implement an inode-based file signature cache.

  Debug the support for partial commits.

  Improve the transactionality of working dirs.
