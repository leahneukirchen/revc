  A Hacker's Guide to Arch 2.0<br>
  
</h1>

<p>
  <b>note:</b> this description presumes deep familiarity with revision
  control and a fairly good understanding of Arch and git.





  <h2>In Brief
</h2>
  <p>
    Each <code>commit</code> (including &quot;imports&quot;) creates a new revision record.
  The revision record contains all files newly modified in that
  commit, along with some metadata.  (&quot;Newly modified&quot;, in this
  case, does <i>not</i> necessarily mean files which are different from
  the immediate ancestor.   Instead, it means files which are 
  different from any in the <i>prerequisit changesets</i> (see below).)




  <p>
    Revision records are independent entities: any archive can 
  contain copies of any revision records.




  <p>
    <code>get</code> consists of building a working dir, reading the most recently
  modified files from the revision record itself, reading the other
  files from &quot;prerequisit commit records&quot;.








  <h2>Namespace
</h2>
  <p>
    A <i>revision name</i> is a nearly arbitrary user-selected name
  for a revision.




  <p>
    A <i>half-qualified revision name</i> is a revision name plus
  an SHA1 checksum summarizing the contents of the tree and
  its list of ancestors.




  <p>
    A <i>fully-qualified revision name</i> is a half-qualified 
  revision name plus an SHA1 checksum summarizing the contents
  of a specific commit record --- the specific bytes written
  by a particular call to <code>commit</code>.




  <p>
    It's good to understand what these names refer to:




  <blockquote>
    
    <p>
      <b>revision name</b> -- what user's like to call this tree.




    <p>
      <b>half-qualified revision name</b> -- a checksum-based description
    of the <i>contents</i> of the tree.   Different trees with the same
    half-qualified name are hard to create accidentally but, if
    SHA1 is cracked to the degree MD5 is, colliding half-qualified
    names will not be a surprise.





    <p>
      <b>fully-qualified revision name</b> -- a checksum-based description
    of a specific set of bytes created by <code>commit</code>.   Identical 
    revisions (in terms of tree content) can be created more than 
    one way using <code>commit</code> -- each will have a different
    fully-qualified name.   It is believed to be &quot;sufficiently&quot;
    difficult to create two well-formed commit records that 
    collisions (accidental or otherwise) are a long ways off (though,
    again, some expert analysis to confirm my intuition about that
    is desirable).




  </blockquote>




  <h2>Revision Format
</h2>
  <p>
    Each revision is stored on disk as a tree.   Most of
  the tree is a &quot;blob database&quot; in the style of git:
  files whose names are derived from a checksum of their
  contents -- you retrieve a file by asking for the file
  having a given checksum.  Some of the files in this database
  are literal copies of files from the tree.  Other files
  in the database describe directories in the tree using a
  portable format.




  <p>
    A revision tree also contains <i>ancestry</i> and <i>prereqs</i> files
  for the tree.  (See <a href="#Special Files">Special Files</a>, below).




  <p>
    A revision tree also contains a text file, <code>ticket</code>, which
  gives the checksum of the root directory of the tree, the
  name of the revision, the metadata (permissions, etc) for
  the root of the tree, and a checksum for the tree's ancestry.
  Any two revisions with identical contents and ancestry 
  should have identical <code>ticket</code> files.




  <blockquote>
    
    <p>
      <i><b>sample ticket:</b></i>




    
    <pre>
      revision: hackerlib.7
      root-blob: 25e74c4fb4eb12dbe77aee0cb9702780cbc2e496.7168
      root-metadata: d---rwxrwxr-x.500.500
      ancestry-blob: 42af15594b1e1354ef75a7fc17b0610ecd950de7.504

    </pre>

  </blockquote>

  <p>
    Finally, a revision tree contains a text file, <code>commit-ticket</code>,
  which adds a checksum for the <code>ticket</code>, a checksum for the <code>prereqs</code>
  file, the total number of files in the blob database, the total
  inflated size of those files, the total deflated size of those
  files, and an additional checksum which (roughly speaking)
  summarizes a fixed format listing of the files in the blob database
  and their sizes:




  <blockquote>
    
    <p>
      <i><b>sample commit ticket:</b></i>




    
    <pre>
      ticket-blob: 05921e0ae2938ed33ecd4b20aabd7f95f8755f4f.177
      revision: hackerlib.7
      root-blob: 25e74c4fb4eb12dbe77aee0cb9702780cbc2e496.7168
      root-metadata: d---rwxrwxr-x.500.500
      ancestry-blob: 42af15594b1e1354ef75a7fc17b0610ecd950de7.504
      ignored-blob: e5a62f693dbcee47764061726063b9285c9a87c1.9
      prereqs-blob: 88f62e3ae6aa0bba21685498d3b0e9e75f80c23f.3170
      n-blobs: 6
      total-file-size: 22732
      total-zip-size: 4669
      blob-contents-blob: 80364ad68a71d0c7273f350de0d0526f4dca0b05.275

    </pre>

  </blockquote>

  <p>
    <b>Note:</b> It is believed (further analysis is desirable) to be highly
 improbable that a malicious attacker will ever be able to forge a
 (valid in every respect) revision whose commit ticket matches (byte
 for byte) the commit ticket of some other release.  Simple counting
 arguments prove that such forgeries are certainly possible so 
 one can't be certain but, at least, the commit ticket is the root
 of a very tangled mess of multiple checksums, file-length assertions
 and so on, making it far harder to break than simply &quot;cracking SHA1&quot;.









  <h2><a name="Special Files"><b><code>{Special Files}</code></b></a>
</h2>
  <p>
    At the top of each working directory is a subdir named <code>.revc</code>.
  It containts control files used by <code>revc</code>.




  <p>
    Note that <code>.revc</code> is not considered &quot;part of the tree&quot; the
  same way that <code>{arch}</code> is under 1.x.






  
    <h3>Manifest and Ignore Lists (<code>.revc/manifest</code>, <code>.revc/ignore</code>)
</h3>
    <p>
      Arch 2.0 only cares about <i>some</i> of the files in your tree: those
  listed in <code>.revc/manifest</code> (a 0-separated list of file names).




    <p>
      A similar list is <code>.revc/ignore</code> -- these are files which are 
  explicitly <i>not</i> part of your tree.   <code>revc-lint</code> and <code>revc-new</code>
  are the primary commands that care about the ignored files list.
  



    <p>
      The <code>manifest</code>, <code>add</code>, <code>del</code>, <code>ign</code>, <code>lint</code>, <code>lsr</code>, <code>missing</code>,
  <code>new</code>, <code>rename</code>, and <code>unign</code> commands manage the manifest list.






  
  
  
    <h3>Ancestry (<code>.revc/ancestry</code>)
</h3>
    <p>
      The ancestry file is used for merging purposes.




    <p>
      Ancestry in revc is a two level list.   All entries in the list
  are <i>half-qualified revision names</i>.  The upper level of the 
  list is the direct lineage of the tree.   The second level of
  the list are trees &quot;merged in&quot;.   A pair of decimal numbers
  is used to describe the structure of the two-level list:




    
    <pre>
        2.0 revc-0.1.1/+&lt;SHA1&gt;      # 2nd revision since import
        2.1 revc-0.1.0be/+&lt;SHA1&gt;    # merged in big-endian support
        2.2 revc-0.1.0joe/+&lt;SHA1&gt;   # merged from joe
        1.0 revc-0.1.0/+&lt;SHA1&gt;      # call this the first &quot;import&quot;
        0.0 nil/+&lt;SHA1&gt;             # the universal ancestor

    </pre>

    <p>
      The direct ancestry there is:




    
    <pre>
        revc-0.1.1  revc-0.1.0  nil

    </pre>

    <p>
      and, as noted, revc-0.1.1 merged in from two other trees.




    <p>
      Whenever you <code>commit</code>, the generated commit record contains the 
  complete ancestry of the newly created tree.  On disk and for
  transport, the list is compressed (and, as you can see, should
  compress well in excess of the usual 50% rule of thumb).




    <p>
      Uncompressed, these lists are still of reasonable size even if
  they contain 10s of thousands of entries.  It is not clear that
  their growth rate will <i>ever</i> require &quot;history pruning&quot; but,
  if so, at least that point in time is quite a ways off.  A list
  with 100K entries would, today, not be unreasonable to store in
  memory (even perhaps iterating over it and indexing it) in most
  environments.  (By contrast, 10K patch-log entries in 1.x is 
  already a pretty uncomfortable amount.)






  
  
  
    <h3>Prereqs (<code>.revc/prereqs</code>)
</h3>
    <p>
      The prereqs list is a list of fully-qualified revision names (see
  above) -- a list of earlier commit records.




    <p>
      When <code>commit</code> creates a new record, each file and directory
  in the tree is compared to all of the files and directories
  in the earlier commit records.   If an identical file is found,
  <code>commit</code> skips the file --- if none is found, the file is 
  stored in the new commit record.




    <p>
      Thus, <code>revc</code> does a kind of &quot;whole-tree delta compression&quot;
  (but does not, at least as it stands now, to sub-file delta
  compression).   By modifying the prereqs list, systems and 
  users can tune this delta-compression along a continuum.
  With only the universal &quot;nil revision&quot; as a prereq, <code>commit</code>
  performs an <code>import</code> or <code>archive-cache-revision</code> type of
  operation.






  
  



  <h2>Changesets: Blob-trees, Tickets, Prereqs, and Ancestry
</h2>
  <p>
    <code>commit</code> creates a changeset.




  <p>
    By default, a changeset is represented on-disk as a directory.




  <p>
    The directory contains a shallow tree of &quot;content-addressable
  files&quot;: each file is stored in the tree under a name derived from
  the SHA1 checksum of the file contents.   (The current code does not
  handle the case of two distinct files with the same SHA1 and size
  but modifications necessary to handle this case are not hard.)




  <p>
    Some of the content-addressable files in a changeset are compressed
  full-text images of files from the tree being committed.   Other
  content-addressable files in a changeset are compressed binary
  &quot;virtual images&quot; of directories from the tree being committed.




  <p>
    A committed file is stored simply as a zipped copy of the file
  contents.




  <p>
    A committed directory is stored as a zipped copy of a binary file.
  The binary file has 1 record for each entry in the directory.  Every
  record is 512 bytes long.   The format of each record is:




  
  <pre>
     Directory Record:

     [... name (256 bytes) ...][... metadata ... ][... contents-address ...]

  </pre>

  <p>
    <code>commit</code> stores exactly (all and only) those file contents and
  directories which are not identical to some content-addressable file
  stored in a <i>prerequisit commit</i>.   A user who has the changeset
  created by <i>this</i> commit, plus the changesets created by all of the
  prerequisit commits, can reconstruct the entire tree.




  <p>
    The <i>ticket</i> in a changeset records the contents-address of the root
  directory of the tree, metadata for that directory, and the name
  of the new revision, and the ancestry of the tree being committed.




  <p>
    The <i>commit ticket</i> records everything in the <i>ticket</i>, but also
  records the list of prerequisit tickets.




  <p>
    The net effect is that changesets form two graphs, both of which
  are acyclic, directed graphs.




  <p>
    <b>The Prereq Graph:</b>  Every changeset points to older changesets
  which are prereqs.  Access to the prereq changesets are necessary to
  be able to extract the tree from the changeset.




  <p>
    <b>The Ancestry Graph:</b> Every changeset lists a set of ancestors.
  Ancestors are <i>not</i> earlier changesets.   Instead, ancestors are 
  listed as symbolic revision names combined with the contents-address
  of the root directory of the ancestor.




  <p>
    The ancestry graph is used for smart merging -- it is used to pick
  the &quot;common ancestor&quot; of any two trees.




  <p>
    The prereq graph is used for extracting revisions from archives --
  it is used to find files unmodified from some other revision.




  <p>
    There is no <i>necessary</i> connection between the two graphs.  Two
  distinct commits can be the same point on the ancestry graph (define
  exactly the same tree with the same name and ancestry) yet be at
  very different points on the prereq graph.   (For <code>tla1.x</code> hackers,
  this is a really nifty (imho) generalization of both of the ideas
  &quot;archive cached revisions&quot; and &quot;skip deltas&quot;.)








  <h2>Archive Format
</h2>
  <p>
    The archive format is designed to be suitable for use as a 
  typical FTP site in which, aside from commit records, people
  might store things like tar bundles of releases, README files
  and the like.




  <p>
    The layout relies on a heuristic that, given a revision name,
  guesses a good &quot;category&quot; for that revision name.   The category
  is a prefix of the revision name:




  
  <pre>
        revision:			category:

        linux-0.1			linux
        arch-tools--devo--0.1		arch-tools
        5.0				MISC

  </pre>

  <p>
    An archive is layed out using categories as a top level:




  
  <pre>
	ARCHIVE/
          linux/
            linux-0.1/
              ...
            linux-0.2/ 
              ...
            linux-0.3/
              .&lt;SHA1&gt;+&lt;SHA1&gt;/
                ticket
                commit-ticket
                ancestors
                prereqs
                &lt;blobs...&gt;
              # linux-0.3.tar.gz could go here

  </pre>

  <p>
    Note that the commit record is stored as a &quot;dot file&quot; (normally
  invisible) named after the fully-qualified name of the commit.
  An archive can have multiple commit records for the same name and
  they may or may not have the same tree contents.
