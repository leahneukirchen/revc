  A Quick Intro to Core Arch 2.0 Commands<br>
  
</h1>


  <h2>Core Commands
</h2>
  <p>
    Arch 2.0 has only a few core commands.




  <p>
    These are:





  
    <h3><b><code>init</code> [<i>directory</i>]</b>
</h3>
    <p>
      Create a <code>.revc</code> subdir in <i>directory</i> (default is the current
  directory) and fill it with the default Arch 2.0 control files.




    <p>
      User's never need to edit these files directly!




    <p>
      Initializing the root directory of a source tree is the first
  step in importing it.





  
  
  
    <h3><b><code>commit</code> [-r <i>name</i>] [<i>subtree</i> ...]</b>
</h3>
    <p>
      Commit a revision using either <i>name</i> or the default name.




    <p>
      With <i>subtree</i> arguments, only changes in that part of the
  tree are committed.





  
  
  
    <h3><b><code>get</code> <i>name</i></b>
</h3>
    <p>
      Retrieve the named revision.





  
  
  
    <h3><b><code>name</code> [<i>new-value</i>]</b>
</h3>
    <p>
      Each <code>commit</code> operation stores a new tree snapshot
  and assigns that snapshot a symbolic name.




    <p>
      The <code>name</code> command reports (or with an argument sets) the name
  that will be assigned to the next snapshot taken by <code>commit</code>
  for the tree containing the current directory.





  
  
  
    <h3><b><code>manifest</code></b>
</h3>
    <p>
      Report the list of files at or below the current directory
  that are in <code>revc</code>'s list of files to be considered by the
  <code>commit</code> command.





  
  
  
    <h3><b><code>add</code> <i>file</i></b>, <b><code>del</code> <i>file</i></b>, and <b><code>rename</code> <i>from</i> <i>to</i></b>
</h3>
    <p>
      These commands modify the list of files reported by <code>manifest</code>.<b></b>


    <p>
      Store a snapshot of the tree in your chosen archive, assigning it
  the default name.





  
  
  
    <h3><b><code>ancestor</code> <i>ORIG</i> <i>MOD</i></b>
</h3>
    <p>
      Given the names of two tree snapshots, report the name of a third
  tree which is a good choice as an <i>ANCESTOR</i> tree for use during
  three way merges.




  
  
  
    <h3><b><code>ancestry</code> <i>name</i></b>
</h3>
    <p>
      Report the history of ancestors and merges that have occured
  to the named tree.





  
  
  
    <h3><b><code>prereqs</code> <i>names</i></b>
</h3>
    <p>
      Report or set the commit prereqs of a tree.





  
  



  <h2>General Properties
</h2>
  <p>
    Your archive (the collection of tree snapshots) is stored in a 
  reasonably space-efficient way as an ordinary tree of files.




  <p>
    Snapshots are cryptographically verifiable and have
  handy human-readable fingerprint strings suitable for
  cyrpotgraphic signing.




  <p>
    You can safely mirror your archive using programs such as <code>rsync</code>.




  <p>
    Individual snapshots each occupy a separate subdirectory in your
  archive -- it safe to copy or move these between archives.




  <p>
    Access to individual files from history is very fast.




  <p>
    It is safe to delete revisions from your archive.




  <p>
    It is safe to use the same symbolic name for a revision twice.




  <p>
    Many convenience commands or operations are needed -- the core
  commands are &quot;core&quot; because they keep the model simple but
  I don't claim they are the last word in UI design.




  <p>
    Many details are omitted from the descriptions above -- for example,
  how to use <code>get</code> to get just a single file or a partial tree;  how
  to use <code>commit</code> to commit changes in just part of a tree.




  <p>
    Because this is an early release, not all of the functionality of
  the core commands is present -- just enough to begin attempts at
  self-hosting.
